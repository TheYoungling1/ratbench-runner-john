"""Stage 4.5 — ldd-based run-time native library discovery.

After ``install_closure`` installs the resolved closure, this stage runs ``ldd``
on each package's compiled extension ``.so`` files and collects shared libraries
the dynamic linker reports as ``=> not found``.  Each missing soname becomes a
``SystemLib`` node (``discovered_by=PROBE``, ``state=MISSING``) with a
``requires`` edge from the owning ``Package``.

This is the *primary authoritative* source for run-time native-lib nodes
(option A of the plan).  The curated ``PACKAGE_TO_SYSTEM_DEPS`` table stays as a
proactive/install-fail fallback (seeded before install; ldd supersedes it for
successfully installed packages).

``os_resolver.resolve`` is table-first with an apt-file fallback that is ABSENT on
slim images.  An unknown soname yields a node with EMPTY ``fix_candidates``
(option A: *need* surfaced, apt *name* not known).  Option B (lazy apt-file)
closes that gap — see plan Future TODOs.

Pure parser + thin executor orchestrator (repo immutability: every "mutation"
returns a NEW ``DepGraph``).

# Shell-quoting notes:
#   * Outer python -c uses double quotes -> inner Python strings use single quotes.
#   * $ in regex end-of-string anchors becomes \Z (shell double-quotes expand $
#     to empty; \Z is not a shell escape and passes through unchanged, then the
#     regex engine interprets \Z as end-of-string).
#   * DockerExecutor wraps in sh -c '...'; its single-quote escaping preserves
#     the inner Python single-quoted strings correctly.

    (fills ``chosen_fix`` only — never the id); then either reconcile with a
