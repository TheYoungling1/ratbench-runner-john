"""Wheel-oracle prior — a build-essential Tool for every from-source package.

Realizes construction-enrichment cluster 1a (design 2026-07-01): the
resolver's own wheel-vs-sdist signal (``Node.build_from_source``, computed by
``wheel_oracle.risk_from_packages``) is the ONLY basis for this prediction —
no curated package->syslib table. A package with no compatible wheel needs a
compiler to build its sdist; that is the one thing this stage predicts.

This REPLACES the deleted ``seed_predicted_native`` / ``PACKAGE_TO_SYSTEM_DEPS``
path. The generic ``build-essential`` this stage seeds is now the FLOOR, not the
whole story: specific ``-dev`` priors (psycopg2->libpq-dev, pycairo->libcairo2-dev)
come from ``build_deps.seed_build_deps`` (the Bucket-B/B.1 curated table + Debian
``Build-Depends`` + PEP 725 ``[external]``), which UNIONS with this floor in the
Phase-B pre-pass — distinct node ids (``tool:build-essential`` vs the capability/
``aptdep:`` nodes), so neither erases the other. Any specific ``-dev`` a
package needs but no prior predicts is still recovered reactively by
``install_closure`` parsing the real build error (stage 4), or ``ldd_probe`` for
runtime libs (stage 4.5). (Declaration mining, cluster 1b, is deferred — not part
of this plan.)

Pure: every "mutation" returns a NEW ``DepGraph`` (repo immutability rule).

    This is the generic floor only: every source-built package needs a compiler.
    Specific ``-dev`` priors are seeded separately by ``build_deps.seed_build_deps``
    and union with this node (distinct ids — neither erases the other).

    For each ``Package`` with ``build_from_source`` not False (i.e., True or None —
    known from-source builds or unknown build mode from degraded resolution), add a
    ``requires`` edge to the single, deduped ``build-essential`` Tool node (created
    once, on first need). Only packages with a confirmed matching wheel
    (``build_from_source=False``) skip the prediction. Unresolved diagnostic packages
    (``version=None``, representing resolver failures) are always excluded. Returns
    a NEW graph; a no-op when no package needs a source build.
